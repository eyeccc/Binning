# Binning
Exploration of different designs of binning (A survey)

Link to paper-preprint coming soon...

# Usage
You can choose your own dataset  from Browse botton. 
Note that we only implement the front-end part. 
Due to browser security issue, it cannot get the full path of the file.
Thus, your file should be in the same directory of texture.html.
Users can change vis type by using the dropdown list.
They can adjust the bin size by changing the value of the slider.

Alternatively, users can directly use draw(filename, vistype) to draw a specific one they like.
